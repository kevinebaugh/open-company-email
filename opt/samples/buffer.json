With response time\n        as our primary success metric, we're prioritizing hiring in November. We also added more specialized roles in\n        the team, for example, having one liaison between each of the Product and Happiness teams in order to\n        streamline some meetings (and cancel others!), as well as one team member focusing on self-help resources.\n        We're now hiring to form a Twitter-specific team, too.</p>\n        <p>We also separated out business support last month. The new business support and customer success teams\n        will focus on the specific needs of customers using Buffer as part of their business strategy. Key metrics\n        for this area will include increased customer engagement, reduced churn, NPS score and customer satisfaction\n        score to mention a few. We're excited to incorporate new tools and continue to hire in this area as well!</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>12,282 replies sent</li>\n          <li>Customer Happiness Percentage: 95%</li>\n          <li>67% of emails got a reply within 1 hour</li>\n          <li>85% within 6 hours</li>\n          <li>54% of Tweets got a reply within 15 minutes</li>\n        </ul>",
